# 🚀 Welcome to the People Analytics Case Study

Hello, business enthusiast! 🌍 I'm Adrián Benitez Rueda, and this project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee data. We cover everything from data cleaning and preparation to in-depth analysis of key metrics using SQL and Python. This case study is a joint project that emphasizes extracting insights from HR data for better decision-making.

## 📊 Project Overview

This repository contains two main parts:
1. **Data Cleaning**: We clean and prepare HR data for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: We analyze employee demographics, focusing on insights like gender breakdown, age distribution, and more, using SQL queries and visualizations.

## 🛠️ Notebooks

### 1. Data Cleaning (`main_cleaning.ipynb`)

- **Data Loading**: We begin by loading the HR dataset (`hr_data.csv`), inspecting the data structure and ensuring it is ready for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: The raw data is cleaned by renaming columns, handling missing values, and ensuring the correct data types.
- **Database Export**: The cleaned data is exported into a MySQL database, ready for analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis (`main_analysis.ipynb`)

- **Data Import**: Using SQL queries, we extract relevant information from the MySQL database.
- **SQL Queries**: We perform various analyses, such as:
    - Gender and ethnicity breakdown of employees.
    - Age distribution across different groups.
    - Identification of key patterns and trends.
- **Export for Visualization**: The results are prepared for export to Tableau, where more advanced visualizations can be created to communicate findings.

## 📸 Visual Insights

This project includes data visualizations created through Tableau and Python, helping to showcase key insights derived from employee data. You can expect visual representations like:
- Gender and race distribution.
- Age groups and overall employee demographics.
- Key metrics like retention and turnover rates.
