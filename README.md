# üöÄ Welcome to the People Analytics Case Study

Hello, business enthusiast! üåç I'm Josemi S√°nchez, and this project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee data. The goal is to explore employee demographics, key metrics, and trends that can assist in better decision-making for HR departments.

## üìä Project Overview

In this case study, we work with a fictitious dataset generated for educational purposes. The dataset is sourced from [data.world](https://data.world/markbradbourne/rwfd-real-world-fake-data/workspace/file?filename=Human+Resources.csv). This dataset was selected due to the difficulty of accessing real-world employee data from actual companies.

The project consists of two main parts:
1. **Data Preparation**: cleaning and transforming the HR dataset to ensure it is ready for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: extracting valuable insights regarding employee demographics, gender, age distribution, and other key metrics.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Processes

### 1. Data Cleaning

- **Data Inspection**: the HR dataset is thoroughly examined to understand its structure and identify potential issues, such as missing values and inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation**: columns are renamed for consistency, and necessary conversions are applied to ensure the data types are accurate.
- **Data Export**: the cleaned dataset is stored in a database for further analysis and querying.

### 2. Data Analysis

- **Employee Breakdown**: using SQL queries, we analyze the gender and ethnicity breakdown of employees to identify trends and possible biases.
- **Age Distribution**: the age distribution of employees is categorized and analyzed to help understand workforce demographics.
- **Insight Extraction**: we explore additional key metrics, such as retention rates and turnover, to derive meaningful insights from the data.

## ü§ñ Chatbot Implementation

In addition to the data analysis, I have developed a Streamlit-based chatbot designed to assist employees with common HR-related queries. This chatbot aims to improve employee satisfaction by providing quick and efficient responses to frequently asked questions.
